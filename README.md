# Automated-Skin-Type-Classification
Automated analysis of skin tone from face images

Pre-processing requirements:
1. Before color correction, each image to be processed must have the background removed as well -- I used the background removal tool available at https://github.com/OPHoperHPO/image-background-remove-tool. The matlab code requires both the original image and the background-removed version.

Required files:
1. Download the dlib "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" file.
